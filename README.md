# SAP Cloud Foundry - Node.js XSUAA example

This is a "Hello XSUAA" application for the SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry Environment that shows how to __use the XSUAA service to secure a REST API__. This code example is based on the [official HelloWorld](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-cf-helloworld-nodejs), you can check out the different branches for step-by-step advice. I simplified some parts, for instance no Postgres Service is needed, so that you can deploy the application on your SAP Cloud Platform trial Account.



## Prerequisites - What you need to get started:
- SAP Cloud Platform account, a trial account is sufficient. [https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/)
- Node.js skills
- Basic knowledege about Authentification, Authorization, UAA, JWT ...
- Some resistance to frustration



## Versions

There are two versions for now. One will show a really simple application using Express to provide a simple REST API. Version two will use the SAP Approuter to redirect users to a login screen, if they are not logged-in yet.
